        <p>Hi, my name is Jalen and I am an American who studied abroad for most of my life. I lived in Bangladesh for 8 years before moving to Thailand for my last two years of high school. Living overseas has given me the opportunity to learn about different cultures and views on life. I believe having these lessons early on in life is a big reason I am now at Illinois Tech. Illinois Tech has a diverse student body that I feel I naturally fit in with. Meeting others from different walks of life is really important in self growth. When I learn different opinions or beliefs I can challenge my own and become more open-minded and self aware. Growing up internationally has well equipped me for the leadership positions I hold today. I am proud to be captain of the Menâ€™s basketball team, an executive Athletic Council member, and an RA. Each of these roles offers different learning experiences, but all of them have one thing in common: interacting with people on a daily basis. Whether it is helping to settle a conflict in the dorms or encouraging a teammate in practice, I am thankful for the experiences I have from studying abroad.</p>
